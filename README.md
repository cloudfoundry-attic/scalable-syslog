[![CI Badge][ci-badge]][ci-pipeline]

The scalable syslog is a consumer of [Loggregator][loggregator] which
transports application logs to syslog drains. It writes messages according to
[RFC 5424][rfc5424] and [RFC 6587][rfc6587]. Here is an example of how it
writes messages:

```
    + Protocol Version
    |
    |  + Timestamp                   + org_name.space_name.app_name                                       + ProcessID (Source)
    |  |                             |                                                                    |
    v  v                             v                                                                    v

 |                                                                   |                                                       |

```

If you see a decimal prefix followed by a space in your message, this is the
length prefixed to the message. This is used to frame syslog messages when
transmitting over a streaming protocol.
